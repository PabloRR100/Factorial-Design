# Reaction Simulator

Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering Final Project.  Jun 2015
This is a collaboration between the Organic Chemistry and the Automatic, Electric and Automation departments.  
**Note**: The entire project was develop in Spanish.

For this project I built a tool for the department of Organic Chemistry consisting on an interactive database system and a reaction simulator tool. Students should be granted by the leader of the laboratory to upload their results and populate the database so future predictions could perform better results.  

### Database Search
The calculations were designed following a factorial design to perform linear interpolations per each of the input variables. The following video nicely sumarizes the exploration of the algoithm through the database.

### Cover special cases
There are some special cases in the search where the behaviour is different. 
The next video is a description of the chartflow where those cases are gathered.

### Determine objective variable
To calculate possible values for the objective value, here is the explanation of how the algoithm would look like:
