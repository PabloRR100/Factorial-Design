# Reaction Simulator

Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering Final Project.  
This is a collaboration between the Organic Chemistry and the Automatic, Electric and Automation departments.  

For this project I built a tool for the department of Organic Chemistry consisting on an interactive database system and a reaction simulator tool. Students should be granted by the leader of the laboratory to upload their results and populate the database so future predictions could perform better results.  

The calculations were designed following a factorial design to perform linear interpolations per each of the input variables. The following video nicely sumarizes the exploration of the algoithm through the database.

There are some special cases in the search where the behaviour is different. 
The next video is a description of the chartflow where those cases are gathered.
